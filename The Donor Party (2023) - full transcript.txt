Hi-- uh, wow, look at you! And that-- all of that. What are you doing here? I mean, it's f-- funny seeing you here. I-- I thought you had an apartment downtown. Uh-- uh, we-- we bought a house around the corner. For the schools. Uh, you remember Gia, don't you? Uh, yeah, last time I saw her, her face was kinda covered by your crotch. I heard you got married. Congratulations. Thank you. Oh, that's sweet of you to say. Thank you. Yeah, I'm a dad! Yeah! Yeah, how'd that happen? I mean, I know how that happened. Just you always said you didn't want babies when we were married. Yeah. Oh, turns out uh, I was wrong. Kids are great. He's a great dad. Really happy for you guys. Thank you. Uh, I couldn't be-- well, we-- We couldn't be happier, you know? I'm living my best life. Yeah, me, too. Yeah. Alright. Well, um, we should get going. -Okay. -Gotta get this in the ground. -Yeah, yeah. -You know? But it was really-- -Dig it deep. -It was great to-- -Oh, I-- -You know? Come on. Let's not smother the-- Really great. Yeah. So great to see you. Can I help you? Hi. Uh, yeah. Um, the-- I have a-- there's a-- I have this plant. Um, uh, I-- it's a dwarf tangerine and I-- I bought it here a year ago, and it-- It's grown some, it just-- it doesn't grow any fruit. And I've tried everything, even like a citrus stake. I think it's growing great! these leaves are gorgeous and lush. But you see this? Something happened to it. Disease? Trauma? Is it gonna die? No, no, it'll keep growing, but it'll never bear fruit. That was supposed to be me, you know? - Yeah. - He said, "Kids will change us. -And I love us." -Men ain't shit. I thought he would change when you had kids and-- Or my brother had kids, and when his cousins had kids, and I waited, and I waited, and then-- he just didn't wanna have kids with me! I know. And this is probably the wrong time to say, "I told you so," but, honey, I've literally been telling you the exact same thing for 15 years. I wasted all my good eggs on that asshole. And now, I'm never gonna be a mom! - No. Yes. - I'm never gonna be a mom! Yes, you are. You just-- you have to get back out there. I am out there! And it's like every good guy is married or they don't wanna have kids. Or-- or-- the older guys, they already have kids and don't wanna have any more. Or the young guys, they just wanna fuck a MILF. But I'm not even a MILF, I'm just an ILF! I just-- I just wanna skip the dating part and get to the mom part. I just-- No. No, don't skip the dating part. The dating part is where all the good fun sex happens. You know, when you-- when you get to the mom part, it's just you know, scheduled sex once a week and the foreplay is like he brushes his teeth. That's me. My mom was the best and she made me feel like I could do anything. And like I was exactly perfect just the way I was. I wanna do that for a little one. I wanna be that mom for somebody. I don't know why you're trippin'. You don't need a husband to have a baby. No, that's true. You can totally adopt! Oh, although adoption is not cheap. I have friends who did it and it's like-- It's like 40 grand all said and done. Oh,fuck me! I wasn't talkin' about adoption. Artificial insemination is worse. Mike and Lydia, they went through six IVF treatments at 25 grand a pop. Well, fuck me! You don't have to buy it. Just go and get some. What? Where are you getting? What? You know, get some. Mm. Mm, mm, mm. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. -Oh. -That's called "stealing sperm". It's not stealing if they freely give it away. -Uh. -Condoms break. Accidents happen. Especially if you plan 'em. No, that insane. You can't do that. You can't just-- Although, I mean, if there-- No. It's just-- it's wrong. Is it-- is it wrong? I mean-- I mean, it could work. -Right. -It could work. What's happening right now? -I kinda think you're the devil. -Mm. But it is not the worst idea ever. If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, then it is the worst idea. -It's the best worst idea. -Oh! How will he ever find out? You know, I'm not going to call him to tell him. You guys aren't going to call him and tell him. I'm not calling him. I mean, most guys ghost me anyway. And this time, I want him to ghost me. And he gets to have sex with you and you get a baby. Win-win. Waa-waa. Okay, I think you guys are forgetting something. Right, um-um. What if the sperm is slow or he's shooting blanks? Huh, we'll have a back up. I'm thinking two, maybe three. We gotta flood the fallopian tubes when the egg drops. Yeah, yeah. You're-- you're talking about an orgy? It's like having three one-night stands in the same night. Okay. Oh my god. No. No, I can't do this. This is crazy. I don't want to just fuck some rando to get a baby. That's why I can't go to the sperm bank in the first place. Besides from the fact that it will bankrupt me. I want to know that the father of my child is a good person. - Right? Yeah. - You know? Like a kind person. Ideally artistic and intelligent and good sense of humor. Argh, who the fuck am I kidding? I'll just freeze my eggs until I find Mr. Right. Idea. What if we found them for you? Is there nuts in that? Huh, I don't know. I can put nuts in it for you. Would you like that? I can put nuts anywhere you'd like. Okay, babe, shut it down. We have guests. Alright, but mom has the kids so we will have time for your special birthday treat later. Don't get too fucked up. I won't. I have an idea though. What if we just send all these jokers home and we have later now? How about that? All of our best friends, you mean those jokers? Well, what about her? What about that joker? I don't know her. Who is she? That's Jackie's friend from work. -Oh, the lesbian. -Yes. Yeah. Why is she here? She's Jackie's plus one. Oh, okay. Oh! Are they-? No. What? Just- Well, why-- why is Jackie coming? Because she is like family. Is she like family though? I don't know. Maybe I just had it in my head that we were going to take a Jackie break after thanksgiving. Alright, she had just found out that Todd was getting remarried. -I know. -Just found out. Believe me. I was sympathetic with all the crying and the carrying on. But did she have to teach our six-year-old about blowjobs? -She did- -All about blowjobs? She didn't hear the whole thing. -Soup to nuts. -She didn't- No, no. Yes. Maybe the soup but not the nuts. That's not even our job to do that. -Alright, you know what? -It's the internet's job. You will barely know that she is here. Okay. I can do this. It's just casual sex. I can do that. I can totally do that. The table looks great. Wait, why are the desserts out already? Do you guys have everything you need? Yes, we do honey. Thank you. -Hi. -Hey, whose playlist is this? These are Geoff's favorite songs. Oh god. - Nope, can't do it. - No, Jaclyn. No, stop, stop, stop, stop. No, no, no, no, no, no. On paper, this all sounded great. But now that I'm actually here, I can't. I can't do it. Okay, well, just listen. I will 100% agree. But please don't leave me here. I- If I have to have one more conversation about IPOs, I will murder someone. Hold on, what's going on? She's reconsidering. No, no, no. You cannot back out. Yes, I can. Because this is crazy. Yes, it is crazy. Like Uber Eats and Standing Desk. But crazy can be genius. Great dress. Yeah. You don't think it's too much? -It's very good. Oh. -It's gonna get the job done. No, ah! Huh, I was gonna return it. Oh, oops. I'm sorry. $450? See? That's what I'm talking about. This dress is not me. Sleeping with three guys is not me. Okay, it is not you. That's clear. Now, is this how you wanna have a kid? No. But is this the only option? Yes. Okay? We did our part. You gotta do your part. You promise that there's no way they can find me afterwards. No, you just need to make sure that no one figures out what you're doing tonight. Because I will 100% throw you under the bus if Geoff finds out that I was part- Hi. -Hey. -Oh, hey. Jackie, good to see you again. Yeah, you too. Happy birthday. It's a book. Could've sworn it was a canoe. It's signed to you. Oh, wow. Thank you. Oh, and isn't it lint? I mean, didn't you give up refined sugar last year? I thought you did. What are you giving up this year? I'm just giving up. -Okay. -He's literally just turning 45. - I know, right? - Thank you so much. I mean, what's the matter with me? Doom and gloom here. Here, let me take this. Here, you put this up. Oh my gosh. Yes, I would love to. It'd be my pleasure. Is he okay? He's fine. None of the men in his family lived past 88. So, now he thinks he's in a downfall spiral. I thought you said this was gonna be a big shin dick. Yeah, well, it turns out Geoff doesn't have enough friends to make it a shin dicks. Well, someone's gonna notice. Too late for that now because donor number one is ready to play. So, are you ready? Well, my ovulation app says it's go time. Go on then. Seize the day. ♪ Come to me ♪ ♪ Just bring your mouth ♪ ♪ closer to my-- ♪ Hi. Oh. Hi. - Hi. - I'm MJ. What's going on? Did you know this was a birthday party? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Oh, okay. I kind of really don't know why I'm here. I'm not even that good friends with Amandine or at all, actually. Well, you can I can be friends. Wow, thank you. Friends with benefits, if you want. - Okay. - Um, so MJ, huh, that's not short for Maryjane, is it? No, no. I wish. Actually, no. I don't wish that my name was Maryjane. -No. -No. And my MJ is for Morris Jerusalem. Morris is my mother's grandfather's name. And Jerusalem is the city where I was conceived. -Oh, that's nice. -I often say, well, thank goodness that I wasn't conceived in Frankfurt because then I'd be quite an MF. -Guys. -Hi. You want to try some of this? It's pretty good. Oh, no, thank you. I'm taking an Uber later. And I like to be of sound mind when I'm -in a car with a stranger. -Oh. Okay, well, you have got to try this. - It's a Syrah. - Okay. Give it a shot. Tell me what you think. - Mm. Wow. - Not bad, right? -Yeah. -Almost makes up for the fact that they call it Syrah Syrah. Ugh. My ex-wife was the regional sales manager for the state. Um, she ran off with the sommally-- the sommally- the fucking wine guy. She ran off with the wine guy. Ah, got you. - Yeah. - Should I spit it out? Would you please? It would make me feel so good. - I'm Armin by the way. - Hi. Hey. You're Molly's friend? The one who works for Jennifer Aniston's charity, right? Oh, I actually did the Standee for you guys. Yeah, my company- Hey, my company works-- we actually make those cardboard standees that, you know, you can sit on star's lab in a movie lobby? -Yeah. -That's cool. Yeah. So, wait. So you know Amandine as well? Uh, she's just a work friend. I mean, you know, she wouldn't know where I live or anything like that. Actually, I don't even work there anymore. I'm moving away to another city far away. Wow. So, Jen is more "Horrible bosses" than Rachel in real life. Noted. No, no, no. She's great. It's just I needed a challenge. Wanted to mix things up a bit, so... You know what? I think that is so healthy to shift gears. Geoff and I- Well actually, most of the guys here, we had a start up. Not like Amazon or anything. But once I got big enough, I had to sell it. Now, I can kind of do whatever I want. It's pretty cool. - Yeah. That's nice. - Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool. I actually put money into GameStop as well. I don't know, well, and I made $3700. - Oh wow. - Nice, buddy. - Yeah, thanks. - It's pretty good. So, it's like, saying-- Now I got a lot of free time, get to travel. Which I love so much. I was working so much before. Right, I guess. Takes a minute to start up. Oh yeah. I mean, all I did was code, code, code and pound energy drinks. Wow. That's why I'm trying to see as much as the world- I'm so sorry. It's just my mom broke her hip. - Oh my god. - Oh my god. I'm just dealing with my brothers. We're trying to figure out if we should put her in our home. Oh, let me know if you need any help or- Nope, done. Done. -Oh, great. -I'm sorry, you were saying? Love to travel. -I have a lot of time. -I'm scared of planes. To do that. But um- She's gonna bail. Well, it sounded to me like you didn't want her to go through with it. It's not true. But do you know how hard it is to find a single man who is disease free in the suburbs? I just- I don't want to disappoint them. It is possible that I may have told them that I have a friend in need of a- Like, a confidence boost. So you're more worried about your guys friends being happy than your best friend? Okay, well call it a win-win situation. I mean, what's so wrong with having a plan B? Oh, I've got a plan B. I've got a plan C. Because the plan is to get her the D. What is it? - What is that? - It's molly. I don't- MDMA. -I don't under- -E. I don't know what you're saying. Ecst- Ecstasy. -I know that one. -Ecstasy, yes. Just enough to prime the pump. Okay. Oh, donor number three. The French teacher whose wife just died. Okay. My friend getting pregnant tonight. Top me off, will you? Oh god, I thought you were the caterer. I am so sorry. Behind the table, cool outfit. I can take it off. Okay. More, more. I like this one. It's floral and complex and yeasty. Like a vagina? I get a slightly different note. It's got a really good mouth fill. I could decant it for you. Let it breathe. Amadine. Barbara. That's a beautiful name. Not my name. I hate my name. I'll tell you what. How about you give me your number and I'll call you whatever or whenever you want. Balls. Yo, Goeff. Can I grab you for two, buddy? -Hi. -Hey, what's up? What's up? Were you just hitting on my sister? Is that a real question? Right, right. Umm, it's just that she's been through a really ugly divorce recently. So... So, you want me to sleep with your sister? That's sweet of you. No. No, no. No, I'm just- I'm worried. I mean, you know, she's very- she's not a lesbian. Are you sure? Because, you know- Would you mind not hitting on my sister at my birthday party please? I would mind. But I won't. It will be my present to you. Wow, thank you so much. - Happy birthday. - Yeah, I'll treasure it. - You should. - Have a great time. - You too. - Not too great. Oh, shit. Oh shit. -Oh shit. -No one told me about this. There's just no good- you know what? Every 10 minutes I have to go. Sweetheart, you can get lasers. It'll zip that right back up. Yeah, it's called a mommy makeover. They stick a laser up there and just tighten it all up. It went from Basset Hound to Chihuahua. Worth every penny. Oh! - Wow. - Stop. You know it's true. You got kids? -No. -Husband? Not anymore. You should keep your distance. You might get baby fever. I'm not kidding. Happened to me. All my friends started having kids. I thought I should have kids. All these friends, they're gonna be gone once she pops a baby out. She'll make new friends. The kids' friend's parents. And she'll think she has new "interests." But they're really the kids' interests. And when the kids graduate, poof, gone so. All these people she invested all her time with, she'll realize she has nothing in common with them. And then she'll realize that her husband is staying too late at work. So, she'll shoot her face fill with Botox, get a boob job. Get a mommy makeover? Exactly. To chase what she used to look like. before the kids literally suck the life out of her. Instead, she'll just look like she's trying too hard. And he'll leave her for an actual 20-year-old. Who loves giving blowjobs? Fucking blowjobs. All because she thought it'd make her life complete -to have a baby. -Oh, no, no. That's got Molly's lipstick on it. -I think this is your shade. -Thank you. I mean, you don't regret having babies, right? Oh, no. God, no. They're the loves of my life. As much as I hate my ex, I'll always be grateful to him for giving me my babies. Listen to me, don't listen to me. I just need to get laid. Okay. We get what you wish for. On that note, I think I'm ready. - Alright. - Do you snorkle? No, I never get into the ocean. Oh god, what do I say? Tell him how wet your pussy is. They love that. I hate that word. Pussy? Yeah. What do you say? I don't. So, when you told Todd to like- Oh, we didn't talk during- Or before. Or after. Oh God. Okay, so tonight, you're gonna say some nasty pornstar shit. Just get disgusting. Yeah, but that's not me. I know that's not you. But tonight, you're not you. Okay? You're not the NPR-loving, farmer's market going, avocado toast eating Jaclyn. You're gonna be something different. You're the Onlyfans, like Jacklina. You're gonna be a slut tonight, okay? Yeah, okay. Okay. You're a slut. -Well, huh. -Slut. Slut - Really? - Yeah. You've never been to swimming? Hey. Hey. Hi. Oh. You like surfing? Huh, no, I would never surf. So, you'd never- you just-- you never do it? No, I'm scared of sharks. There is great white sharks that you should be scared of. But they're east coast, man. All the west coast sharks are white sharks. I got you, girl. Cuddly nice sharks. You gotta get out there. Geoff is over there. Geoff?I'm Shopia. Excuse me. Okay. Am I in trouble? No. Ugh, God, I need a drink. Your glass is right there, just-- Oh no, molly. Molly, that's Molly in there. You drank it all. That's all of it. It's gone. It's in your body now. -Okay. -Okay, wow. -Let's just- -What? Wow, wow. Don't need those. -Right, um. -Yeah, so. -Oh. -Wow, wow. Wow, that is- That is so tone. Oh, thank you. You do pilates? I do, yeah. I can tell, I can tell. You can touch it if you want. I would. I want. Okay. Alright. Okay, you're sure that you want me to do this? I think I couldn't be more clear. Yeah, I do. I do want you to do this. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Great. I'll be over here. Okay. Oh, wait, I don't have a condom or anything. Oh, ah! You know, I don't want to assume when I go out this- I just- it's just in the bag. There's a-Oh, do you have a medium? -Here. -Okay, wow. Wait, we should set the mood? I have Spotify premium, no ads. - We don't need that. - I can put a slow jam playlist. Okay, wait. I've- I've never done this before. -Well, no, I mean I've had sex. -Yeah, okay, good. That's great. You know, but- Not with people around. It's just us here. Wait, that's not true. That's not true. Actually when I was in college, my girlfriend and I, we went camping. -Wow. -Consensual. And- and-wow. Wow. And there was a tent next to us. And there were people having sex in there loudly. Say some pornstar nasty ass shit. It's not like- I will murder. They ruined our lives. Pussy. I want you to murder my pussy. Excuse me? I want you to tell me. How you're gonna murder my pussy? -Yeah. -Okay. Well, I'll use my penis to strangle it until it's dead. Yeah. Oh. No, this is weird. This is weird, I'm sorry I don't- I'm sorry. I don't talk like that.I'm sorry. It's okay. I just thought talking dirty would turn you on. I don't know what to do to turn you on. I don't know how to do this. Are you kidding me? You? You do not have to use any gimmicks to turn me on. Honestly, I would really just love to kiss you. If that's okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would love that. Hey you guys. Are you doing okay? Do you have everything you need? -Thank you so much. -I want you to have the best time ever. Oh, thank you. Oh my god, baby. You guys look great together. It's just such a beautiful couple. Stay the night if you want. Make yourselves at home. Hey girl, let me talk to you. Hey, come on over here. - How are you feeling? - Oh my gosh. I feel great. I love these people. These are- these are good people. - Yeah. - Oh, I forgot. The donor number three cancelled. Who are you gonna get to fill the empty slot? Her empty slot, like, a vagina? - That was good. - Like, her vagina. I know a guy, I'll call him. But you need to sit down. Oh my god, you are such a good friend. You know, we should do things, you and me. It doesn't always have to be the three of us. Right? Just call me, girl. And also, you're so pretty. I never told you that before. I want it, but I'm not going to. - You better not. - Because I know I shouldn't. I'm doing the work. Good, good, okay. Do you wanna touch my hair? My hair is so soft. I have a conditioner that costs $125. - That's a lot of money. - That's so dumb. It's beautiful. Okay, I'm gonna go call my guy, but you sit down, alright? Don't do a lot of things. Okay. I'll sit in my den. I have a great chair in there. - Lay out. - It's fluffy. Hi, where's the closest bathroom? It's right over there. Wow, your boobs got big. Do they hurt yet? They will. When you start nursing. Are you gonna nurse? I loved nursing so much. Oh my gosh. But it does hurt when it chafes. And I got mastitis so bad one time, Geoff had to put a hot compress on my boobs and milk me like a cow. Oh, this is so much information. -Are you okay? -Oh, no. They got better. Thank you for asking that. Hey, so-- and the bathroom is there. Thank you. Remember, breast feeding is best feeding. Okay. Hello? I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Okay. Well, pregnant lady needs to pee-pee. I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Okay. I'll find another. Good luck with that. -That was fun. -Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. Okay. Oh no. Oh no. What? The condom broke. Oh, no. Oh. Oh my god. I'm so, so, sorry. I don't know how this happened. You know maybe- Maybe you're just- You're too big and the condom burst. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. This is just- I'm on the pills, it was just- You know, in case of STDs. Oh, don't worry about that. I'm clean. I give my blood to Quest all the time. They should give me a punch card. What? Oh, I have a blood disorder. What? Like, are you a hemophiliac or-? No, no. I just bruise really easily. You know? Oh, up here. -See that? -Oh. That's from a collision with a shopping cart. Oh, thank god. For you. Yeah. It's pretty funny actually. Child protective services used to call my parents -all the time. -Oh. Yeah. Why don't you go first. And then I'll come later. Just so it's not so conspicuous. - Oh, you mean now? - Yeah. Okay. - Hey, it's me, Amandine. - Oh, okay. ♪ Well, I'm gonna put you down on the microphone ♪ ♪ And drop down low like Al Capone ♪ Okay. Getting a little help from gravity. Listen, I totally appreciate you finding him. He was super right. But did you know that he had a blood disorder? Okay, getting a full DNA workup was not on the checklist. But on a related note, donor number three did cancel. Oh, the French teacher? - Oui. - Crap, he sounded promising. Well, on an unrelated note, there might be a little itsy-bitsy problem with Molly. Argh, is she drunk? - Well, I wouldn't say drunk. - Oh, she used to do this to me all the time in college. I'd meet a guy I was really into, and then she'd get super hammered and then I'd have to walk her back to dorm room. That's probably it. I'm gonna go. I'mma see you out there. - Hey. - What? Can you get me a snack? No. Kahlil, get on up here buddy. Your turn, your turn. You burn him. Happy birthday, buddy. There we go. Alright, this is my favorite. In his garage, we're working about to make millions. Right. - And what happens? - His septic tank breaks. And so, we are literally working in a shit. And what did you say to me? What did you say? - I couldn't smell it. - Couldn't smell it. Couldn't smell his own shit. I just thought you guys were trying to get out of working. - We were. - Well, shut up about it. -I destroyed-- -Tim! Everybody, Tim is here. Tim is here. All of the beautiful artwork that we have in our house, it's almost all him. I love them. I was gonna ask. I love the dog paintings. So fun. Yeah, I tried to buy it all. You basically did, I mean. Jackie, Jackie, it's Tim time. It's Tim time. Tim. - Shh. - Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. -Come on. -Tim time. -Tim time. -Wait, what's Tim time? Honey, your gift is here, and your's. Here we are. Yap, careful, careful. It's still little wet. - So is she. - Excuse me, excuse me. What-? Oh my god. Wow. -I mean- -MOLLY: Look at that. Thank you. Thank you, Molls. Aww. Alright. Wow. Wow. Okay. Alright. She just loves art. You know? Yeah, yeah. -Yummy. -God. Tim, I mean this is phenomenal. Really phenomenal. How did you get the-? Well, for your face, I actually used one of your old wedding photos. I had to age it up just a little bit. - Just a little bit. - Okay. And then for you body, I used that guy. - How are you doing? - Oh, man. Yeah. He's pretty proud of himself. It is so good. Oh, he's so talented. He does baby portraits too. You have to do our's. Okay, okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Yes. Thank you. So you must really love dogs. Um, actually I'm allergic. You know, people just send me pictures of their dogs and then I paint them. But you must like them a little bit, right? I don't. I can't stand them. They slobber. They crap on the floor. They eat your shoes. But people love dogs, so easy money. I don't understand what's going on. We were just very friendly and then who the hell is this guy? Yeah, so what he's got a handsome face and perfect hair and considerable talent? Oh god. Oh okay, alright. You know what would make a good impression? A Jeff Goldblum standee. She loves him. You will be like her hero. Yeah, but right now, all I have is some of the Dodgers. And an old Batman. To the Batomobile then. I'll be back. That was the terminator. Oh my god, I'm losing it, Amandine. I'm losing it. Go find it, go find it. Okay. I'm coming right back. Okay, so what about babies? I can't stand babies. I'm sorry, I can't stand them. Babies are- babies are stupid. I mean, you ever tried to have a conversation with a baby? It's remarkably one-sided. Well, they're babies, so they can't even talk. Because babies are stupid. So, you don't like babies or dogs? Or surfing. I hate surfing. Well, how do you make art about something you don't even like? That's why they call us starving artists. Speaking of which, there's the food. Excuse me. Okay, we got a problem. MJ got feelings. -What do you mean feelings? -Like, feelings feelings. You need to bounce off before he gets back, okay? Well, I'm thinking of bouncing right now. Absolutely not. No. One D down. Two more Ds to go. I can't do this. Yes, you can. The goal is to be a hoe. Mom. Hoe now, mom later. There's a through line. Okay. Wow. You weren't kidding about the starving artist. It's Pavlovian. All these art openings always have amazing spreads, and if I keep my mouth filled with food, people think they're rude if they come up to me and ask me "What were you trying to say with this piece?" Just give you the money and leave you alone, right? You wanna be my agent? Oh, here we go. Yeah. I'm sure she's perfectly nice, but I get hit on by that type all the time. What's your type? Oh, unbearable self-involved assholes. Know any? Okay, you're right. I should apologize to her. I'm sorry. I'm a little salty. My ex recently got in touch with me and called me a sell-out because I painted a mural for YouTube. One mural, okay? Diego Rivera did his best work for Rockefeller. Commissioned mural. The Sistine Chapel was a commissioned mural. Commerce and art. Corporate art. What's the big deal? Now- now my ex is going out with some 50-year-old. He's 50. He designs food courts at malls, okay? -I'm a sell out? -Oh, fuck off. I'm sorry. I haven't had the pleasure. And you're not going to. All the men here have younger wives. Look. Our hosts, your patrons, seven years apart. - Well, he looks old. - He has no hair. Preggo and Deer in Headlights, more like ten years. Silver fox and Kim Kardashian. And especially Surf and Turf. Why do you think that is? All women are gold diggers? Supply and demand. There's not much demand for aging aimless artist. But you two have fun. I think I'm in love. You look kind of cute when you get your ass handed to you. -Thank you. -Yeah. Hey Tim, I love it. Thank you so much, again. Although, I'm gonna have to hide it in my office so Molly doesn't get sad every time I take my shirt off. Thank you. I was trying to convey the feeling of freedom. Oh, yeah. Yes, sounds like somebody surfs. Not as much as I'd like to. Heard that, my man. Yeah, when I'm out there, man- Shh, you talk too much. Stop talking. I didn't really say anything. Oh, Tim. You have to show Jaclyn all of your art. We have so many of his pieces. We have a lot. They're basically my Borgias. You're so funny. He's so funny. And good looking, huh? Sure, yeah, hmm-mm. Yeah, why don't you go on the gallery walk upstairs? No, I thought nobody was allowed upstairs. No, special people are allowed upstairs. Oh. Go, go, go, go. Got it, yeah. I'll show you upstairs. Okay. Okay, what? I don't- You what? What? I do. You don't. I do. Do you wanna go have a glass of water? There's a dog. Another dog. Dog. Dog. Baby, baby, baby, baby. There's a good one this way. And a life study. That's Molly. I'm not at liberty to say. Ah, well, I- it's lovely. You know, the use of your brush strokes and colors. Please, please, please stop. Can we please not talk about my work? Okay. Let's, huh-- let's talk about you. That sounds even worse. How about we talk about you? How about- how about we don't talk? Okay. Yes. Yeah. I love this. I love this. Stop, stop. I love this. I love all of your features. All of it. And when you speak, you speak with so much expression. This here. This. I wanna paint you. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. It's so refreshing to be with an older woman. Just past all this baby bullshit. You know? And all these fucking gold diggers. I only wanna be with older women who are post menopausal. How old do you think I am? I wasn't talking about you. Oh, oh. Yes, you have a bush. You have actual pubic hair. You have actual pubic hair. I've been working with these life study models. And they're all completely shaved. They look like barbie dolls. It's perverse. You know, they look like little girls. Who wants to make love with little girls? Hopefully nobody. -Exactly. -Yeah. All these women mutilating their bodies to live up to some imagined standard the patriarchy has set for them. Why do women have to be perfect little C-cups and be completely shaved, you know? They don't, they don't know? Let it grow. Let it go wild. Let it go untamed. Get in my mouth, wild long pussy hair. Or maybe just- I mean I think I prefer just a little trimmed. No, you're wrong. Let it go. Live in your skin. All the years that you've lived, all of that hair, all of your blemishes, all of these sunspots, these liver spots all of them. All of these age spots. All of these herpes scars here. All of these wrinkles. Wrinkle, wrinkle, wrinkle. Wrinkle, wrinkle, wrinkle. It's your imperfections that make you perfect. Nope, can't do it. What do you want me to say here? Honestly, nothing. Because everything that comes out of your mouth is just drying me up. I'm trying to compliment you here. And that's what you landed on? I'm not trying to be a dick. Oh, well then, it must just come naturally. Hey, hey. I'm just trying to do you a solid. A what? Molly told me that you needed to fuck the pain away and so do I. We're the same. You said it. I think the best idea is for us to let our bodies do the talking. -Ouch! -I think the best idea is for you to never ever touch me again. My painting hand. There she is, there she is. Hello, how was it? I want the dets. I want the dirty, dirty dets. That was fast. That didn't happen. No. Why didn't you do Tim? Maybe I would've if he didn't treat me like a pity fuck. You're supposed to find me nice guys. So, I can have nice babies. Well, you meant also cute and artistic and funny and smart. I got four out of five ain't bad. And look, you're gonna love my guy. I don't know. I think I'm good, you guys. No, you're not good. I know you don't want to roll the dice with MJ. It's just one person. And it's MJ. Okay, fine. But he has got to go. No, I can't kick out Tim. Yes you can. It's your house. But do I have to? Yes, you do. Sisters before misters. That's easy for you to say. You don't have a mister. -She's right. -Thank you. Sisters before misters. That's what we always say. -We do. -Oh, but poor Tim. Oh. - Poor Tim? - Poor tiny Tim. Wait, is he tiny? Or is he big? Or is he little? I don't wanna know. Because I don't want anybody- I do wanna know. But I don't wanna know. But I do wanna- It's like killing me. It's tearing me apart. Stress is the future, right? Choking the present. - Okay. - What you guys all need is more time on the ocean. - Ah, yes. - You know. Wow, wow, wow. Thank you. So, I heard it didn't go well. So, you should probably leave so it's not weird. Because I don't want it to be weird for Geoff. I should leave? No, no, no. I'm friends with both of you. She's the one who should leave. She should leave. That's not gonna happen, Tim. But it's okay. But it's okay that you go. Because you know well, we love you. And you know what? It's always okay. You should go. No, no, no. Maybe- maybe I don't wanna- Maybe I don't wanna go. What is that? That was so much fun. Oh my gosh, do it again. No, no. Okay, just one little spin. -See that's nice. -Just hold on a second. Jacklyn? -No. -On land, you guys are CEOs. -Idiot. -But out there in the ocean, -I'm chairman of my board. -Oh nice. What an ass hat. Not you. Yeah, no shit. Hey, what about you? You got anything on your horizons I should have my radar on? -Geoff? -Huh? Oh, no. No, nothing special. You know, it's a bunch of stupid pitches. It's like Uber for kitty cats. It's like Door dash from my ass. I don't know. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. Please, please, please, please. Please don't go, please don't go. Just buying myself another hour of smiling stupidly. You want a hit? No, I'm good. Thanks. You hook up with the asshole? I mean, artist? No, I didn't. I'm not judging. No, seriously, I didn't. What about the guy with the glasses? Was it that obvious? I didn't see anything. You're um- you're with the surfer guy. Yeap. But I'm pretty much here alone. The second we get around his friends it's like I don't even exist. I thought an older guy'd be past all that bullshit. That's when they summit Mt. Bullshit. - I know. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah. But it's so different for us. Like, I wanna have kids. It's not like we're in our 20s. I mean I'm probably a skosh older than you. This is gonna sound crazy, but I work with horses and we start breeding our marriage when they're 5 and put them out to pasture when they're 15. Which is what in human years? - 35. - 35. - I'm 31. - Yeah. I mean if he's not serious am I gonna have to get started on another guy? God. You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it. We wait for everything in our lives. We have to wait for them to ask us to prom. We wait for them to ask us to marry them. We have to wait until they're ready to have kids. Well, I am done waiting. I am done waiting for permission to live my fucking life. Yeah. You know what? -Fuck him. -Yeah. Fuck this party, I'm out of here. - Hi. Is this thing on? - Hi, hello. - Hello. - Oh, hi. -Is it your birthday? Yeah. Ah, happy birthday. Okay. One of you bozos got me a stripper? Come on Geoff, you know I'm not that fool. Holy shit, that is a shirtless chef. Wait-wait, who that? Who is that? He does online cooking videos. shirtless. As in zero shirt. I'ma subscribe. Yeah. You're welcome. You wouldn't happen to be Jaclyn? Would you? I would. Ah, pleasure to meet you. Oh, pleasure is all mine. Amandine has told me so many fascinating tidbits about you. Uh-huh. It's a little hot in here. I don't know why I'm wearing this anymore. Ah, oh look, raddish. Hey, can I steal- Okay. Can I steal Jaclyn for a second? -Maybe later. -No. It will just take a minute. I don't- Geoff, I- I'll be- I heard you quit working for Jen Anishton. Yeah. I mean it's not totally confirmed yet, but yeah. Okay, well, do you have anything lined up? Not yet. Just kind of going around trying to figure out where I want to land. Uh-huh. Well, that's perfect. Because I have a friend who just started a non-profit that supports educational programs for girls in third world countries. I know. That's great. Well, listen. Why don't you give them my contact, and I- Okay, Meera. Yeah. Hey, I want you to meet somebody. This is-- this is Jaclyn McGinley. -Hi. -She just left her position as the Director of Jen Aniston's foundation. What? Now, you guys talk. -Jen Anishton? -Yeah. You know, I'm a huge fan. I was just at her benefit at the Getty last month. Well did you- Did you do that? -I did, yeah. -You did. Oh my goodness. This is fate. Yes. Yes it is. Because, let me tell you. I was at the grocery store yesterday, and I was checking out the tabloids. I don't usually check out the tabloids. But I just happen to see Jen. And they were talking about how she's childless. And I went home to Kahlil and I told him, "Why doesn't she just adopt?" You know? And then I meet you here tonight. So why doesn't she adopt? Oh, I don't- We don't really talk about that. Well, would you? Would you? Because adoption is just such a blessling. Yeah. I mean, we adopted four of our six. One from Mozambique, one from Peru, one from Russia and one from China. All you need is Australian, and you got a continental set. Oh my god, you're funny. Isn't she? She is very funny. Girl, you hungry? We got some more cheese that came out. Oh, you know, I'm lactose intolerant, so. -I bet you are. -Yeah. So- But I was saying is that, you know, motherhood is just a blessing. No matter how you do it. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. Do you feel any difference in the bond between your adopted children and the biological children? Not the first time someone's asked me that. Let me be just completely honest. With my first two, I thought that, you know, I don't know if I could love another the way I did them, but when I saw Donya's face, I just- I knew she was my child. I don't know. Love is not really a zero-sum game, you know? Wow, that is so sweet I wanna kill myself. - Oh my god. - Butter fingers. Hurry now. Ah, ah. This way. Let's go faster. Must go faster. Sorry, I thought the situation called for bit of a diversion. Yeah, thank you. Of course. So, you work in the not-for-profit space. I admire that. Very satisfying. Are you doing that on purpose? I'm sorry, I'm not exactly sure what you mean. The talking like Jeff Goldblum thing. Well, I certainly hope I can measure up. Oh, I think you're even better than the real thing, truly. So, you're an actor? Do you have anything against actors? No, no, no. No. I think that's great. You know? You're sensitive and artistic. Is that why you're so muscly? Oh, this is my instrument. It is Stradivarius. -A Stradivarius is- -I know. -Oh. -The kind of guitar Jimi Hendrix played. So, what have I seen you in? Well, I got cast in an episode of Flash. But I wore mask so you can't really tell it was me. I bet you were great. The fight choreographer thought so. Yeah. I mean, it's not easy being a Latino actor. The Goldblum thing helps out. I get to go out for hot nerdy types now. I like hot nerdy types. Yeah, it's better than type-cast as a gang banger. I go like "What's up?" You know what would be a dream role? Playing Goldblum's kid. Like, in a Jurassic sequel or West Anderson movie. Like, the son he never knew. And I can play against type. I can play someone stupid, like- I want you to fuck me, stupid? Oh, wait. You mean like, you want me to fuck you COMMA stupid, like, you think I'm dumb? I want you to fuck my brains out. Oh, I see. You are hot, oh my god. You're hot. Which brings me to WFTs. Right? -Weed fungible tokens. -Oh. Kind of like an NFT that you can smoke, okay? But it's also on the blockchain. Every ounce of weed you buy or every preroll you buy- -Okay. -Oh. This guy's out of here, now. It's cool, it's cool. You know, some people aren't into weed. -It's totally cool. -Yeah. So, it is a weed product. You get it from the-it's data? You do order it on data. I'm sorry, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Absolutely cool. Hey dodo bird, what the heck are you doing here? I forgot Nermie. Oh, rats! Well, where's nana? She's in the car waiting. Oh, is she? Oh, yeah. There she is. Hey, you know it's my birthday, right? And I get whatever I want on my birthday, that's the rule. So, what I want is for you to get in there and eat all of your left-over Easter candy, every single thing. Get in there! Gobble it up. You can have a goodnight. You bitch. Hey, Sophie. Hey, girl, what are you doing? Hi, string bean. Hi. You're supposed to be at your grandma's house. I forgot Nermie. - Okay. - Alright, go on up and get it. Or maybe not, because when I will be awake passing my bedtime, I will turn into a zombie, tripping over things. So maybe your mommy should go up. No, she can go get it. No, she can't. Um-umm. Oh. Okay, alright. Mommy will be right back. I love you so much. Okay. How's your night? - Good. - Yeah. Ow. Oh my god, what are you doing? I'm not even here. Oh, oh. I'm sorry, but it sounded like you had a really good moment. Oh my god, Molly, get out. Come on. I mean it's not like you haven't heard me have sex lots of times. We were roommates in college and I used to have sex all the time in the bedroom. But she was sleeping. I wasn't sleeping. Oh, see? So that's okay. Okay, okay, I'm gone. I'm not even here. No, you guys, take your time. I just needed this. Right look, I can't even see you. Okay, strip the beds when you're done. Is that good for you? Oh my god, yeah. I mean, I think the last 10 seconds, that was the best sex I've ever had. Ever. Thank you. Look, I know I'm not the real Goldblum, but I really hope I made your wish come true. You have no idea. This is so unfair. You're hell of smart, you do charity work, and you are smoking hot, especially for someone with stage 4 lymphoma. -What? -It's okay. Amandine told me. And honestly, thank you. As an actor, I don't have a ton of money and I can't give nearly as much as I'd like to charity. I always thought of Goldblum thing as a gimmick for parties. But knowing that my skills could bring you joy in the end, I just- I'm deeply honored. Yeah. I hate to sound pity with everything you're going through but you don't have any STDs, do you? -No. -Oh. Normally, I would use a condom. but seeing as how you're Mormon and only have a week to live, I thought I could take the risk. Are you strong enough to get up on your own? You need help? I got it, thank you. Yeah. I'm just gonna take a minute. You rest. Okay. Now I hate surfing. Oh boy. Hi, happy birthday. -Welcome, thank you. -Thank you. Thank you for having me. Oh, thank you. Is Armin-is Armin still here? Is Armin here? Yeah, yeah, of course. And he's, you know, had a couple. Okay, should I go, or-? No! No, no, no. Of course, not. No, god. You drove all the way here. I mean, please, make yourself at home. Have something to eat, have a drink. -It's so good to see you. -Oh my goodness, you too. -Happy birthday. We'll talk. -Alright. Alright. Dude, is that- Hey, I'm so sorry. Oh fuck, not her. I know, I know. Molly mentioned it, I couldn't uninvite her. Do you want me to -ask her to go? -No, no. That makes me look like I can't handle it. And you know, that's how the terrorists win. So, no. Can you believe how fat she got? Yikes. Oh buddy, that's not fat. -She's fucking pregnant? -Yeah, I'm so sorry. I didn't know how to tell you that. No, it's fine, it's fine. You know what? I'm gonna go say hi to her. No, don't say hi. Why would you say hi? Don't say hi. Kegels are key. -Oh, yeah. -Just keep doing that. Joyce, hey. Fancy seeing you here. Yeah, well, they're my friends too. Yeah, because of me. Are we really gonna do this at your best friend's party? See, you said it. My best friend. So. Do you want me to leave? Oh, now you care about what I want. Hmm. No, you know what? I'm sorry. It's fine. We're grown ups. And congratulations. I am very happy for you and you look beautiful. -Thank you. -Yeah. I appreciate that. I feel bloated and disgusting but- No, it suits you. The, huh, pregnancy. Not the- How is Peter doing? You don't really want to know that, do you? Not at all. I just hope you're happy. - I'm very happy. - Good. Good, good, good. Yeah. Yeah. Great to see you. -Cool. -Yeah. Make a wish? Is that what I am to you? A charity case? He was already on my original list because of the Goldblum thing. But he just got cast in a play and he was supposed to perform tonight. I had to think of a life-or-death reason to get him to skip it. So- -Cancer? -That was the only way I could get him to agree to go raw dog. Dead girls don't need condoms. But Mormon? Oh, that, you know that kind of just slipped out. -Hey. -Hi. You see that pregnant woman over there? The one on the right. That's my ex. And I'm about to say something or do something that will get me excommunicated or in prison. So, you know, could you distract me or something? -Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah, sure. -Okay. Okay. What's this from? Oh. Knee replacement. Warranty ran out a couple of years ago. So- Oh, I can give you a good referral for your mom's hip. My guy is like, the best in the biz. So- Oh yeah, great. Thank you. Yeah. I think scars are pretty sexy. -Oh really? -Yeah. Well, I do have another one. Yeah, right here where Joyce ripped out my heart with her bare hands. Do you wanna see it? - Wow, Joyce? - Yeah. Oh, well, you know, it's a terrible name for a villain. -Yeah, it really is. -Yeah. It's even got joy in it. How can I be mad at that? I walked in on mine getting a BJ. Blowjobs are overrated. You're just saying that to me to feel better. Yeah, I am. 100%, blowjobs are awesome. You know, they had the nerve to send me a Christmas card. -What? -Yeah. So, I drew a dick on her face and sent it back. Nice. See that in there? Those are my friends. And she had her friends. I just don't get it, why does she think she needs mine? You know? I know it's pathetic, but like, fuck, come on! No, no, I totally get it. I ran into my ex with his beautiful new wife and their baby. The baby that he didn't want to have with me. At my garden shop. Did you shove him into a cactus? I mean, that would have been my go-to move just right in there. -No, but I should have. -Yeah, you should have. Yeah. You know, my mom got divorced at the age of 44. And I can honestly say I don't think she's ever had sex since. I think she's hanging out in the wrong retirement homes. -Yeah? -I really do. Thing is I don't feel any different than I did when I was 25. Yeah, same. It's crazy. I went to see this band last week, and I swear to you, I raised the average age of that room by at least 10 years. -Yeah. -Yeah. And I caught the eye of this woman and I smiled at her, and she looked me like I was a pedophile. Okay, but in her defense- -What? -You just- wait, guys at clubs are creepy. They are. I mean, I go dancing and I swear every single guy in there is looking at me like I'm in heat. Why can't a girl just look fly and go dancing, you know? I hate to break it to you but dancing has always been about sex. Yeah. I mean, I saw this National Geographic video. Are you flirting with me? Anyway, I saw this video of this crazy little red and yellow birds and they're doing like, this mating ritual, and I swear to you, it looked exactly like the Hammertime move. No idea what you're talking about. MC Hammer? Hammertime? Can't touch this? I don't know. Can you show me? I mean is it hard? -Serious? -Yeah. -I mean yeah. -What does it look like? -I don't know. -I'll show you. - Okay. - Are you ready? Uh-huh. - So, it's like- it's like. Wow. That is- that is something else. I mean, I would definitely swipe right. - Yeah? - Yeah, I would swipe right if I were a bird. Oh okay! Good, good to know. Can I ask you something? And it's 100% okay if you say no, obviously. Yeah. Can I kiss you? I just really wanna kiss you. I'm not supposed to. Oh, okay. Why? Because Molly is my best friend and Geoff is your best friend. And if it didn't work out between us then that would be awkward for them. Right, yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, then who would invite us to this- I was just thinking, I mean, kissing doesn't -have to mean anything, right? -Totally. We can just make out, just not be in a relationship. Nope, yeah. Can I ask you something? And you can 100% say no. Yeah. Do you wanna go have sex? 100% yes. Okay. ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Let's get together ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ You think forever ♪ Hey, hey. -Hi. -There you are. I love you. I love you too. -How are you feeling? -I feel hot. I am so hot, right?

What's up? Hey, man. You sneaking around Jaclyn too? What? She's quite the slippery mix, that one. Okay. Oh shit. Hey, do you know where Geoff is? I love this party. - Hi. - Hey. -Hello. -There's the birthday boy. -Yeah. -Get in the pool. Get inside me. Sweetie, why don't you get out of the pool, huh? No, no, no, no. You come in the pool because guess what it is? It's later. Get in your birthday suit you birthday boy. And come on. This whole pool feels like sex. I don't think now is the best later, okay? Fine. Then just go back inside. No, I mean- Look, you know I'm totally down for the later thing, the plan. -Just now is- -MOLLY: It was a moment. And it was gonna be beautiful and perfect. But you ruined it. And so, I guess we'll just keep never ever having sex. Ever, ever, ever, ever. And then one day we'll have sex and it will be like, -"We have to throw a parade." -I'm gonna go get Jacyln. Yay, we had sex. So, you and Armin. What am I gonna tell Molly? Girl, I told Geoff I wasn't flirting with his sister which is a promise I don't intend on keeping. Okay? You're the best. I'm here for moral support. Okay well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Hey guys, have you seen Jackie? - No? Alright. Hey, have you seen Jackie? You gotta be kidding me. You too? You know, you have a beautiful wife. You should take care of her. Or someone else will. Okay, okay. Listen to me you flea market Picasso. Your next words, I would choose them very carefully. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Or what? Oh! He made me spill my drink. I think you should leave, huh? I would prefer not to. I don't give a fuck. Occupied! Oh shit. I was just doing crunches. What do you mean occupied? Oh! I'm sorry, Geoff. I- I need you to get Molly out of the pool where she's swimming in her under things. Okay, absolutely. -Okay? -Geoff, does this mean I'm not invited to Thanksgiving? Get her out of the pool! God! ♪ Get your hands up ♪ -Hey. -Hey. Hi. Hi. Just- I just have to go help Molly. Oh, and let's just keep that to ourselves, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Definitely. On the down low. The QT. Totally. Then again, it's like we're not in junior high. Right? We don't need Geoff and Molly's permission to I don't know, say, go to a concert. I'm on the board at StubHub and I can get us primo seats. What do you say? Yeah I mean, yeah. That could happen. Yeah, okay, cool. Got you a glass. No, no. You've heard of NFTs, right? This is weed fungible tokens. It's an investment. Hey. Geoff won't have sex with me. I don't think his birthday party is the best time to do it. You know? We barely even have sex anymore ever. Honey, you guys have been married a long time. You know, at the end for Todd and I, we had sex maybe like, twice a month. Yeah, but you were unhappy. When we started dating, we had sex two times a night. We just recently went on a romantic spa getaway and we had sex one time in three nights. Maybe men slow down as they age. No, that's what I wanted. That's not me. Well, this definitely is you. I mean, this reminds me of some of the fun times we had in senior year. Right? Because I used to be fun. Like, I was fun, right? But I'm not any fun anymore. - Yes, you are. - I'm not. I'm not even a fun mom. I thought I'd be a cool mom. But I'm not. I yell. I yell at my kids. I do it, I do. Everybody does. Come here, come here. I almost had sex with Tim. What? I really wanted to. Molly, he's the worst. And it's your fault that I didn't do it. I just was thinking about you and Todd, and I didn't want to break my marriage. I love Geoff. I love him. He's a good man. I'm so bored. I'm like, so, so bored. And I just- I hate my new friends. Because I- No, no, no. I don't-I don't hate them. I just- I do hate me when I'm with them. I fucking hate all of it. Like, I hate dance try outs. And I hate room moms. "Oh, please upload a photos of your sweet little angels into the Shutterfly site." Why didn't you upload any photos? You forgot to upload the photos. Could you just do that please? Could you please do that?" Jackie, don't be a mom. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. But you won't be fun anymore because I'm not fun anymore. And I'm never gonna see you. When do you even see me? I'm like your best friend. Wait. Am I even your best friend anymore? Of course, you are. Molly, come on. Sisters before misters. I love you. I love you. Also, why am I in the pool? I don't know. Maybe I thought everybody would get in. Yeah. Maybe it'll be a good idea for you to get out and do the cake. Oh no, the cake. Oh no, it's Geoff's birthday. I ruined Geoff's birthday. No, no, no. I think I have you beat there. It's true. It's probably true. Alright, okay. You know, I love you. I love you too. Can I- Can I borrow you for a sec. I'm just helping Molly with the cake. Yeah, it'll be great. It's okay. I'll be right back. Okay. Cake, frosting. I'm coming for you candles. Joyce, hey. I just wanted to introduce you to my girlfriend, Jaclyn. Huh. How convenient. It's a pleasure to meet you. How long have you two been together? We're not actually "dating" dating. Yeah, but it seems promising. You know, just nice to be with someone who doesn't play games. Oh, yeah. I get that. I do adore games. Probably because I enjoy the company -of other human beings. -A lot, yeah. I shouldn't be in the middle. Is everything alright over here? Are these people bothering you? Who the fuck is this guy? -Uh, he- -Wait a minute. I know you. Are you the shirtless chef? Oh my god, I love your brined chicken breasts. They're so good. It's the smoked paprika and pineapple juice that makes it boom. Do you drink a lot of pineapple juice? - Tons. - Ah, it's got that sweet sauce? Yeah, it's got that sweet sauce. Okay, what is going on here? Just talking to people at a party I was invited to. So. Hi, it's me MJ from the bathroom. I know it's not Jeff Goldblum, but it is a dinosaur and they're apex predators and you're the apex predator of my heart. Hey yo, before you leave, we're gonna have a little survey. Show hands who here has not had sex with Jaclyn tonight. Show of hands please. One, two, three, four, five. It's more than I would have thought. Did you have a gang bang at my birthday party? No. No. Okay, whoa, you're slut shaming her. No, it's truth telling. She fucked four guys at my house. Oh my god. When you went upstairs. Please tell me that you did not have sex in my bed. No, I didn't. He is the only guy I didn't have sex with. I buy that. Yeah. Obviously, I mean, you're uninvited to Thanksgiving. You know what? This guy? Yeah, okay. I get it. You had sex with the shirtless chef? Lucky. And this one, yes, okay, I get it. But him? Really? Him over me? You've gotta be kidding me. I thought I was your wish come true. You are. ♪ Happy birthday- ♪ -Oh, for fucks sake. -♪ To you. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Everybody singing. ♪ Happy birthday dear Geoff ♪ What are you? ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ -What is the matter with you? -Honey, make a wish. I love you. I wish this night would fucking end. It didn't. That was pretty dark. I should go. No, no, you're not going anywhere. Didn't it mean anything to you? Of course it did. It was fun. Can't that be enough? But physical touch, that's my love language. Well, acts of service are mine. Jaclyn, I thought we had a connection. We did. We do. You slept with Armin? But I asked you not to. Why not me? Wait, Molly. Did you have something to do with this? No. No, no, no. She told me way before the party not to have sex with Armin. -Oh. -Okay, why not me? This is like "The bachelorette." Yeah, with fucking. Oh, there's fucking on "The Bachelorette". You guys, there is a really simple explanation for all this. Jaclyn has stage 4 lymphoma. She's got a week to live. So, she slept with a bunch of guys. Who are we to judge? Wow, you look amazing for stage 4 cancer. You really do. - Really hot. - Oh Jaclyn-jaan. This is why you quit Jen Aniston's charity? Wait, you know Jen Aniston? Can you put in a good word for me before like- you know. No, I'm not dying, okay? And I didn't quit my job. And my mom didn't break her hip. And I think that covers all the lies. And I am really, really sorry if I hurt you guys. I'm sorry, Geoff. I'm sorry if I ruined your birthday. Apology accepted. I'll get the door. - Oh. - We were just making out in the closet. It's not a metaphor for anything. You know, if anybody should be having sex, it's me. It's my party. It's my party. Oh Geoffrey, grow up. Where are you going? - The party's over. - What do you mean the party's over? Oh. Enjoy your walk of shame, slut. I knew you'd come back for me. Listen, you misogynistic untalented nut sack, if I'm really such a slut, then why didn't I sleep with you? And also, fuck you for calling me a slut. I can sleep with whoever I want and however many people I want. Just because you didn't get laid doesn't make me the bad guy. And actually, it was deliberate choice not to sleep with you because the very thought of a miniature you make me sick. Wow, why would there be miniature me? Because you were all selected for a very special purpose. I gotta say, it's beautiful. Is this a Mormon thing? Like, you're sister wives? Wait a minute. Is this a key party? Oh my god, is this a coven? Where the fuck are my- Never mind, I got it. You told me the condom broke. It did. It did technically. You know, I just- I might have helped it a little bit. Girl, this is deceivious. I like it. She wants a baby. So, one of you lucky guys is gonna be a baby daddy. Yay. And who wants cake? Well, at least I know it's not mine. I pulled out. Umm. -How? -Life finds a way. Okay, so which one was I? Oh god, I after- I'm gonna be sick. Yeah, I want a DNA test. Yeah, I feel really used right now. Like, I'm losing money coming here. I didn't eat carbs. Bottomline is, none of these men gave their consent. What you did is fraud. Well, it's only fraud If she tricked them into having sex. I mean, look at her. I say they hit the jackpot. Thank you. Stop fucking whining. I know y'all wanted to get a piece of Jackie's McGinley's Vaginley. This was just supposed to be a one-time thing. I'm probably gonna plan B the whole thing anyway. Oh, no, no. Don't do that. Each and every one of you are good and decent men. Except you. And I'm so sorry for lying. But I had a really good time. But if we met in real life, okay? On a real date. Who would you pick? Because if it were up to me, I would pick you in a heartbeat. Oh, that is really thoughtful and amazing to hear. Okay. Well, that settles it. Oh my god. Huh. - Get up, man. Get up. - Jaclyn, will you marry me? -No. -I don't want our baby to enter the world a bastard. Yeah, that bastard could be my kid. Huh, let's hope not. Points for creativity. But legal or not, this plan is insane. Yes, you're right. It is insane. I didn't want to get pregnant this way. I really didn't. I would love to have a baby with a loving husband. And yes, I could adopt and I could go to a sperm bank. But I want to know who the father is. Because one day, I can look at my child and I can say, "Your father was a kind and decent man." And they don't have an app for that. -Oh my god. -Hmm. I came up with this crazy... You think what I'm thinking? I can get a prototype up in a month. ...selfish and a horrible person. And I'm sorry. I just wanted to have a baby of my own. If I still could. I mean, god. When you put it like that, I just-it's- Are you insane? Are you insane? Have you all people lost your minds? This- this woman stole your sperm. She stole your sperm, man. She stole your sperm. She stole your sperm. She's a sperm burglar. -What? -Yeah. You ask me, your ex got off the crazy train just in the nick of time. Oh! God dammit. I wanted to do that. Oh my god. My water just broke. - Oh no! - Is that all -coming from me? -Baby you're water boarding him. -Oh my god. -It's in my mouth. -Salty Brian. -I think that's gonna stain. Oh my god. You have to take me to the hospital like, now. Baby, I'm three tumblers deep into this scotch here. Well, what are you gonna do, ding-dong? I can take you. I can take you. I got this. Isn't there a breathing thing you could be doing right now? Yeah, right. Remember baby, -hee-hee-hoooo, hee-hee-hoooo. -Okay, hee-hee-hoo. Fuck you. I wanna push, it's coming. No pushing in the car. Jaclyn, we're close, right? Yeah, yeah. Minutes away, minutes away. Oh look, look, put this here. You can put that right under there. Squeeze your legs together real tight. Because it's real leather. It's real leather. We paid for this nice leather. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Wait, what's up? My dad was a piece of shit who was never around. You have to promise me you're not gonna be like that. I'm never gonna leave you. Ever. Okay? I know you're scared. I'm scared too, but we're a team, okay? It's you and me versus everybody. - Okay. - Okay? -Okay. -Okay? -Yeah, yeah. -You ready to meet our daughter? -Yes. -Come on. -Yeah, yeah. -Let's do it. Let's go. - Here's a wheelchair. - Oh god. Easy. Okay, now you can push. Hee-hee-hoooo, hee-hee-hoooo. Hee-hee-hooo. Crazy. There isn't gonna be anyone there for me. - No. - I'm gonna be all alone. I've got no one by my side, no one to hold my hand. Oh my god. What have I done? I've just been- I've just been so focused on getting pregnant that I didn't even think about how I was gonna raise the kid. I mean, why would I choose to be a single mom? This is crazy. This is something we should have thought about like, three hours ago. Hold up. I was raised by a single mother. -And I'm the shit. -Yes. I don't know that I'm gonna be a good mom. Hey, I do. I know you're gonna be a good mom. -Yes. -No, you don't know that. -I do. -No, you don't. Forget about all the therapy that the kid is going to have to have after he finds out how I got pregnant. I mean Goeff and I, we always saw it's a good day if we only added 15 minutes to our kids' therapy. Yeah, but you guys have each other. I've just got myself. And I'm no picnic, guys. You know that. I mean, what if I ruin this kid? I won't let you. You need to tap out. I'm there, boom. Yeah, me too. If you need to tap out, I'm totally gonna pay for a babysitter for you. Y'all like the straight white sisters I never had. Are you serious? I love you guys so much. I love you. Ladies, this zone is for loading and unloading only. - Okay, just a minute. - I'm gonna need you to move your car or I'll have to impound your vehicle. -Okay. -Okay. Take me home so I can give the birthday boy the ride of his life. Because he has definitely earned it. -Yes. -And I'm gonna go sit on his sister's face because I've earned it. - I love you guys. - I love you. Thank you. I mean and who knows this is even gonna work, right? - What are the odds? - I mean... It's just gonna be a little cold. There you go. -There's the heartbeat. -Oh my god. Do you mind just holding still? Thank you. Oh, hold on. I think I see another. What? Okay, one. There's two. And yap, that's three. Congratulations, you're having triplets. What? Yay, three babies.
